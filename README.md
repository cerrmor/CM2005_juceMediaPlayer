# CM2005_juceMediaPlayer

This application was built as a "Projucer" project in conjunction with visual studio 2019. 

The Juce Media Player is a music application that allows two music files to be loaded and played/mixed. A user can control the volume and speed of play back as well as the location in the piece of music. Music files that have been added are added to a searchable playlist and can be recalled every time the application starts. users can manually control playback with a simulated record interface.

This application was written in C++ following the methodologies of Object-Oriented Programming and was the Cap Stone project submission for CM2005 Object Oriented Programming
